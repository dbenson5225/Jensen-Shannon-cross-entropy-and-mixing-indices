# Jensen-Shannon-cross-entropy-and-mixing-indices
These matlab codes implement Kullbach-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon cross-entropies in order to compute the mixing index and mixing rates between two distinct water bodies.  The theory is contained in the preprint "The Concept of the Mixing Index" submitted Dec. 2025 to Water Resources Research.  A preprint may be obtained by emailing the author dbenson@mines.edu.

Two code solve simple 1-D diffusion in finite domians with reflecting boundaries with a variety of user-controlled initial conditions. One code is simple 1-D and the other is 1-D in radial coordinates.

Another solves the time- and space-inhomogeneous BVP described by Mays et al. (Water Resources Research 48 (7) (2012) W07501) and computes the new mixing indices and rates and compares them to scalar dissipation rate.
